# Blake C Miller Side Scroller

Hello! This is my side-scroller. Really, this is just a rough draft for what a final game would look like. My game has the player infinitely scrolling to the right, trying to avoid enemies. I added a mechanic that kills the player when they contact an enemy, so the game is much more challenging.

What I would like to have done is the following: 

* I would like to have incorporated more graphics. As it stands now, the placeholder graphics are still being used. I attempted to have the player sprite rotate within its script, but it seems to not work currently.
* I would have liked to add more to the level. This is barely a Minimum Viable Product, and it is not too challenging.
* I would have liked to remove fall damage. This seems to be a bug, I'm not sure, but it doesn't fit with my design philosophy as of now. 
* I would have liked to add more audio, specifically sound effects for death. That would make the game more satisfying.

As it stands now, I'm not ashamed of my work, but I would have liked to incorporate those things.

# 07-Side-Scroller

Let's build a 2D side-scroller! I have given you some files to start playing with, mostly a culmination of exercises and other resources we have explored throughout the semester.

The Level Class can import a (rudimentary) level file to populate the level. An example can be found in level_1.game. Feel free to alter or expand the file format.

Feel free to use any appropriately-licensed sprites, graphics, music, or sounds (or make your own). Any game should have a goal and opportunities for mastery.

There is a lot still to do, but I hope you have fun with this. Hopefully, you have developed the skills and the tools to make this an enjoyable, creative assignment.

To turn in the assignment, submit the URL to your GitHub repository.
