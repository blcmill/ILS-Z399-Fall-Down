# Fall-Down
This is our game jam product! Play it by running game.py.

In our game:
* You control a ball rolling from side to side!
* You use the arrow keys to move.
* Your goal is to reach the bottom of the level without going past the bottom or top of the screen.
* Levels are randomly generated!
* The game ends when you reach the bottom.

Have fun!
